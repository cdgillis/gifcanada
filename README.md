# gifcanada

This app uses GIPHY APIs to populate the webpage with Canadian gifs of your choosing (there are a few examples to get you started!).


Instructions:

1. Select one of the topic buttons to load 10 gifs. 

2. You'll notice the gifs are static (unmoving). Click any gif image to play, click to pause again, and so on.

3. Try selecting a different topic button, which will add 10 more gifs, and so on. 

4. Type a new Canadian topic into the textbox and click "Make New Button" to create a brand-new, customized topic button in the array. 

5. Now test your button to see if it works!


Technologies utilized:

HTML, CSS, Google Fonts, Bootstrap, API, JavaScript, and jQuery, which change the HTML dynamically.
